## Guidelines

- The arrow buttons on the left and right should move to the previous and next months, respectively.
- Use plain JavaScript; no jQuery, React, or other libraries.
- Don't worry about browser compatibility (just make sure it renders in the latest version of Google Chrome).
- Don't be too concerned with responsive behavior. We won't judge if it doesn't look great on mobile.

We expect that this task will take you about 2 hours to complete. If it's taking you longer, feel free to submit what you have and write us a note about what was most challenging for you.

## Evaluation

- Your work will be graded on correctness. Does the calendar render properly?
- We'll look for maintainability. Could someone come along in 6 months and easily make changes?
- Upgradability is important, too. Could your work be easily extended into a more complex calendaring project?
